# My CKS learning notes
## Introduction
These are my notes took when I was preparing for the CKS exam. Hope you'll find them useful!

### Tips
1. Study, study, study
2. Practice, practice, practice
3. Dig on YouTube. It's full of very brilliant talks about Security in general and Kubernetes scope. Some are also linked in these notes.
4. Purchase a course. The **Kubernetes CKS 2022 Complete Course** by [Killer Shell's](https://killer.sh/) _Kim WÃ¼stkamp_ is brilliant. Below there's a link to that.
5. Get comfortable with searching the docs
6. Get comfortable in using imperative commands (es: `k create role...`)
7. More practice, practice, pratice
8. The most important: have fun!
