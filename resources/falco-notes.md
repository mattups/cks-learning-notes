# Falco

**Falco** is a Cloud-Native runtime security tool. Its capabilities are:

- **ACCESS**: Deep Kernel tracing
- **ASSERT**: Describe security rules and detect unwanted behaviour
- **ACTION**: Automated responses to security violations

# Writing Falco rules

[Rules](https://falco.org/docs/rules/)

[Falco Examples](https://falco.org/docs/examples/)

- `macros` allows you to re-use snippets inside the rules files. They can contain logic
- `lists` instead cannot contain logic

```bash
- macro: container
  condition: container.id != host
  # If the event is not generated by host, it is the container
```
